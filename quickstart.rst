OSDC Quickstart
===============
1. Apply and obtain an account via either the `public resource application <http://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/apply>`_ or the `protected resource application <http://bionimbus-pdb.opensciencedatacloud.org/apply>`_. If you are not sure, use the public resource application.

  * **Note**: The OSDC consoles uses federated login. If your organization is on the list of `InCommons members <https://incommon.org/federation/info/all-orgs.html>`_, please apply with that email. Otherwise, we also accept gmail and yahoo email addresses.

2. Log into the `main OSDC console <http://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/console>`_ for all resources except the Bionimbus Protected Data Cloud, which has its own separate `console <http://bionimbus-pdc.opensciencedatacloud.org>`_. (details ref)

3. From the console, upload or generate a key pair to use for cloud access (details ref)

4. From the console, launch a virtual machine (VM) (details ref)

5. From a terminal, or a program like PuTTY in Windows, access your virtual machine by first ssh into the appropriate login node with the username provided to you and then ssh'ing to your VM. If you're having trouble, please see :doc:`ssh_troubleshooting`. The login nodes and the user to login into your VM is:
